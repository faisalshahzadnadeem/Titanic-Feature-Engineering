# Titanic Feature Engineering

This project demonstrates feature engineering techniques on the Titanic dataset using Python and Streamlit. The application performs various data preprocessing steps including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and creating new features. The processed data is then displayed using a Streamlit web app.

## Features

- Load and preprocess the Titanic dataset
- Handle missing values using median imputation and mode replacement
- Encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding
- Scale numerical features using standard scaling
- Create new features such as FamilySize
- Display raw and processed data in a user-friendly web interface

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-feature-engineering.git
   cd titanic-feature-engineering
